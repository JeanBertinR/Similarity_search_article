# Similarity Search with GenAI

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for the research article "Advancing Similarity Search with GenAI: A Retrieval Augmented Generation Approach" by Jean Bertin. The article introduces an innovative method for similarity search using generative models.

## Files

- **code.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used for the research.
- **BIOSSES_dataset.csv**: CSV file containing the BIOSSES dataset used in the study.
- **requirements.txt**: package version list used for the study

## Usage

### LaTeX Article

The LaTeX article source code is available on ArXiv. 

### Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook `Similarity search RAG approach.ipynb` contains the Python code used for the research. You can open it in a Jupyter environment and run the code cells to reproduce the results.

### BIOSSES Dataset

The `BIOSSES_dataset.csv` file contains the BIOSSES dataset used in the study. It includes 100 pairs of sentences from the biomedical domain along with similarity scores.

## Note

The Jupyter Notebook and the BIOSSES dataset are available for public use. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to contact me at jean.bertin@mines-paris.org.
